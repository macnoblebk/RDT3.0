# Project Title: 
## Reliable Transport Protocol 3.0 Implementation

### Description
Implemented a reliable data transfer service using the stop-and-wait protocol (rdt3.0) capable of handling bit errors 
and packet loss. This project involved both sender and receiver implementations running at the application layer using 
UDP as the underlying transport service.

## Technologies and Skills
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries/Modules: Socket programming
- Concepts: Reliable data transfer, error detection, retransmission, acknowledgment, stop-and-wait protocol
- Tools: Command-line interface, debugging, Git

### Achievements and Contributions:
- Successfully implemented a reliable data transfer protocol that can handle common network issues such as bit errors and packet loss.
- Demonstrated ability to design and implement complex network protocols.
- Ensured high reliability and efficiency in data transfer through robust error handling mechanisms.
- Enhanced problem-solving and debugging skills through rigorous testing and validation processes.

### Impact:
- Improved understanding of network protocols and error handling mechanisms.
- Developed a reusable and extendable codebase for future network-related projects.
- Provided a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as implementing more complex protocols or integrating additional security features.

### Future Enhancements:
- Implement encryption for secure data transmission.
- Add logging functionality for better monitoring and debugging.
- Extend the system to support more advanced protocols and features.
